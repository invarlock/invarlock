# Local configs

This directory is for local, user-specific YAML presets and guard overrides.

- The repository ignores everything here by default (see `.gitignore`).
- Prefer keeping committed examples under `configs/presets/` and `configs/overlays/`.
- Start from `configs/local/quant8_calibrated.example.yaml` (copy/rename, then edit).
