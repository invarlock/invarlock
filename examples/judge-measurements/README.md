# Frozen-answer judge example

This synthetic one-case fixture demonstrates offline import and report rendering.
It contains too few independent units to satisfy its policy and deliberately
returns `insufficient_evidence`. It is not a live provider qualification result.

Copy this directory to a fresh working directory, then run:

```bash
invarlock evaluate request.yaml --preflight --json
invarlock evaluate request.yaml --unsigned --json
invarlock report evidence --html report.html --markdown report.md --junit report.xml --json
```

Add `--fail-on-policy` to evaluation for exit 7 on the inconclusive policy result.
The unsigned evidence cannot establish recipient acceptance. To publish signed
evidence, use a fresh output directory and `--signing-key producer-private.pem`
instead of `--unsigned`. Verification additionally requires an independently
maintained judge recipient policy, not a policy copied from submitted evidence.

See the [judge reference](../../docs/reference/judge-measurements.md) for the
contract boundary, statistical assumptions and recipient verification command.
